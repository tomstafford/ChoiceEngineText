## In a dark wood

This is the dilemma. We believe in order. Things happen for a reason. The universe, of which we are part, obeys causal laws. This determinism promises us an ordered, and a comprehensible one, a world that follows natural laws without requiring explanations based on magic or deities.

And yet our subjective feeling of freedom opposes this causal universe. Our experience of ourselves is as uncaused causers. We have the unavoidable experience of choosing. Out from the centre of ourselves a choice arises, uncompelled by history. Each choice is made by us, and so it could have been made otherwise. Not only can we not avoid choosing, but we are compelled to believe that this choosing matters.

[John Searle](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51904.Freedom_and_Neurobiology) said that even the most harded determinist, when faced with the restaurant menu, makes a choice - they don't throw up their hands and say, "There's no point me choosing between the chicken or the lentils, my decision has already been pre-determined!"

But still we feel a contradiction between our belief in a causal universe and our experience of ourselves as making choices, choices which appear as interventions in the causal flow of the universe, choices which we feel to be meaningful can't themselves be pre-determined.

Things happen for a reason, but surely we are not mere things!
