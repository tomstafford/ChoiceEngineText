This project started as notes on a talk, "Free will, Neuroscience and the Power of Reason" given to the [University of Sheffield Secular & Atheist Society](https://www.facebook.com/events/618961544893961) 11 December 2014.

Thanks to Henry Cooke ([@prehensile](https://twitter.com/prehensile)) for advice on bots, Leila Johnston ([@finalbullet](https://twitter.com/FinalBullet), and to those I've talked with about these issues over the years (but who do not necessarily endorse the ideas in this essay), especially Nicol Harper and Laurence Piercy.

Donate: if you enjoyed this project, you can donate via PayPal [here](paypal.me/tomqstafford). Proceeds will be split between the design team, who did far more work than they were paid for, with Tom's 1/3rd going to [City of Sanctuary](https://cityofsanctuary.org/), an organisation working to build a culture of hospitality for people seeking sanctuary in the UK
