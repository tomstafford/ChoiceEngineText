## The uselessness of philosophy

I'm not going to solve this one today. You can check the journal archives or the publishers catalogues, people have been arguing about this for millenia and there's no sign that the debate is going to let up. 

Even though I think I've reached a point where I know what I think, I still get caught by the emotional power of the dilemma. I'm happy that we live in a deterministic universe, but I still wake up some days with the existential heebee-jeebies. "It can't be true", I feel, "that my thinking being is just a part of the unthinking causal machinery of the universe".

But yet I go on believing it.

I can't tell you what philosophers, psychologists and neuroscients believe about freewill, just what this psychologist believes. Probably it is most useful to think of this essay as 'tasting notes' for your futher consumption of writing on this topics. 

I've got three important points I want to make, one about each of the topics in the title. For freewill I want to explain *why* I came to be so convinced that determinism is compatible with free choices, in any worthwhile sense of that phrase. For neuroscience I want to point out a dangerous misconception that seems to me to drive lots of the discussion of causation of psychological phenomena, and hence why so many claims that we are unfree are overblow. And for the power of reason I want to reexamine some of the psychology literature that people use to invoke the claim we are driven by  irrational forces and put it into the wider context which I've explained here, showing how things like ideas and reasons can have a real and legitimate causal force in a deterministic universe. 

Let's go!
