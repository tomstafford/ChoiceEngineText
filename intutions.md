# Intuitions

Did I convince you that simple rules can lead to the endless, generation of unpredicable forms? This is why I don't think determinism is any threat to our free choice.

Our choices are free because they are ours, not because they are independent of the rest of the universe. They arise from the bit of the universe which we occupy - *our* history, *our* brains, *our* thoughts. This is what makes them unique, personal, unpredictable. 

And yet. 

And yet.

Even though I avow this, it doesn't sit comfortably. Maybe you're the same. My intuitions tell me that the riddle isn't solved. 

Part of this is how deeply felt is our natural born dualism<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. We feel like our minds are not just different from our brains, but a different kind of stuff. Non-physical thought stuff, existing in a different realm from [the meat of our bodies and brains](https://mindhacks.com/2011/07/07/theyre-made-out-of-meat/).

I think if you tried to make a diagram of how people naturally thought about the mind and brain it would be something like this:

DIAGRAM OF MIND AND BRAIN INTUITIONS

Our mind existing above and seperate from our brains, and maybe our true inner selves existing above and seperate from our minds. If you think like this it doesn't sit right to think that your mind is your brain. Perhaps you even react in disgust when you find out that physical facts about your brain affect you and your mind at all.

A better image is this one:

DIAGRAM OF MIND AND BRAIN CUBE

Mind and Brain are different sides of the same thing, just like a bicycle has wheels but it can also have a speed and direction. These are properties and functions, both intimately related to each other, existing intertwined but different kinds fo things<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: Paul Bloom's book is "[Descartes' Baby: How the Science of Child Development Explains What Makes Us Human ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225880.Descartes_Baby)" is great on the idea that we are 'Natural Born Dualists'

<a name="footnote2">2</a>: Maybe this view of things is more common that I thought: here's Christian Jarrett summarising research which found that [Neuroscience does not threaten peopleâ€™s sense of free will](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/23/neuroscience-does-not-threaten-peoples-sense-of-free-will/)
