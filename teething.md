# Teething

The Choice Engine is an experimental project, and some bits of it are turning out to be more experimental than others.

Some users are not seeing the replies to their tweets. We haven't quite got to the bottom of this but our current best guess is that, to be sure you see tweets from @ChoiceEngine you should:
 * follow @ChoiceEngine
 * visit Settings & Privacy > [Notifications](https://twitter.com/settings/notifications_timeline) and de-select "Quality filter" 
 
Sorry about this, it has something to do with Twitter's efforts to protect us all from spambots. This is also the reason the account has to broadcast tweet regularly, rather than just reply. 

 If you have done these things and still you don't see replies, please get in touch because we'd like to know about it and maybe you can help us fix it.
 
 In case you wondered, we have considered these possible factors:
 * The account is not protected
 * The account is a verified developer account
 * The tweet has read/write permissions (the replies are being sent, but they are not showing up in other people's TL or notifications)
 * The behaviour isn't true for everyone (some people see replies okay)
 * It is not a twitter-capacity limitation
 * It is not (entirely) due to twitter clients, since the problem can manifest in the native twitter app.
 
 If you know about how twitter governs filtering, please get in touch!
