## You have a map

[Roger McGoughs poem about maps here]

Choice Engine is about the neuroscience of free will, about our intutions about freedom and choice, and about complex systems and what they can teach us about the first two things.

Choice Engine cannot solve the dilemma of free will for you, but it does map out some paths through the woods. Some things that worry people about free will shouldn't. Some apparent contradictions aren't. Finding out more about neuroscience doesn't diminish our responsibility, or our selves.
